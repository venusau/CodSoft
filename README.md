## CODSOFT INTERNSHIP - Python and Java Programming

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and Java installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/) and Java from Oracle's website (https://www.java.com/).
3. Install the necessary libraries or modules for Python and Java if any are required (unknown at the moment).

### Usage Guide

The internship focuses on developing GUI-based applications for both Python and Java that can run on any operating system. Below are the usage instructions for each program:

#### Python Programs:

1. **To-Do List Task Application**:
   - Run the `To_do_list_task.py` file.
   - Add tasks by entering the task description and pressing the "Add Task" button.
   - Mark tasks as completed by clicking the checkbox beside each task.
   - Delete tasks by clicking the "Delete" button next to the task.

2. **Calculator Application**:
   - Run the `calculator_task.py` file.
   - A GUI window will open with a calculator interface.
   - Use the buttons to perform basic arithmetic operations.

3. **Password Generator Application**:
   - Run the `password_generator.py` file.
   - Enter the desired password length and choose whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
   - Click the "Generate Password" button to get a password meeting your criteria.

#### Java Programs:

1. **ATM Machine UI**:
   - Run the `ATMGUI.java` file.
   - A graphical ATM interface will appear.
   - Simulate basic ATM functions like checking balance, withdrawing, and depositing.

2. **Number Guessing Game UI**:
   - Run the `NumberGuessingGameGUI.java` file.
   - A window will prompt you to guess a random number between a specified range.
   - Try to guess the number within the given attempts to win.

3. **Word Counter Java Program**:
   - Run the `WordCounterMinimalGUI.java` file.
   - A simple GUI will allow you to input text, and it will count the number of words in the text.
